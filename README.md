## Introduction

Hey there! My name is Nghi, a 29-year-old who's been on a bit of a journey. I've got two bachelor degrees: one in accounting and one in English from Banking University. Spending four years crunching numbers as an accountant, I decided to chase my passion for making cool websites and applications.

I started learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and ReactJS on online courses to making frontend stuffs. But after about three years, I figured out that just knowing frontend wasn't cutting it. So, I dove into the backend world, learning about things like NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB.

So excited to keep learning and using my skills to bring cool ideas to life in the world of software engineering!
