## Summary

- Generators are created by the `generator function` `function* f(){}`.
- Generators do `not execute its body immediately` when they are invoked.
- Generators can` pause midway and resumes` their executions where they were paused. The `yield statement pauses` the execution of a generator and `returns a value`.
- Generators are iterable so you can `use them with the for...of loop`.
